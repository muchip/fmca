/**
 * \defgroup ClusterTree ClusterTree
 * \brief The ClusterTree module introduces a structure onto the parametric
 * surfaces.
 *
 * Therein, the ClusterTree class takes a Geometry and introduces an
 * element struc- ture on it, in the form of an ElementTree . Each
 * ElementTreeNode of the ElementTree corresponds to an entire parametric
 * mapping (at the trees first level) or to a sub element induced by a recursive
 * refinement strategy. The leaves of the tree correspond to the elements on
 * which the SuperSpace introduces shape functions.
